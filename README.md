# Booking and Revenue Insights for Hotel in Summer season.

## Problem Statement
Ramada Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Ramada Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. So, they want a report in form of visuals which can describe why they are loosing market to regain their market share and revenue. 

## Solution Approach
I am provided with many excel files of summer seasons of different hotels which includes the booking details, category of hotels and rooms, and the revenue generated each day of every hotel.

# Booking and Revenue Insights for Hotel in Summer season.

## Problem Statement
Ramada Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Ramada Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. So, they want a report in form of visuals which can describe why they are loosing market to regain their market share and revenue. 

## Solution Approach
I have been provided with many excel files of summer seasons of different hotels which includes the booking details, category of hotels and rooms, and the revenue generated each day of every hotel. I asked the relevant question with hotel manager so that I can create the dashboard which will be clearly able to answer those questions. After that I have decided to create a visual report consisting of level 1 and level 2, this helps the manager and the departemtn easily getting the insights according to their work in the company. Level 1 contains the total insights like Revenue generated, Occupancy % etc. Meanwhile, Level 2 metrics describes the more related terms in the Hotel business. Accoridng to the need the user can have a look at this report. Before going to the visualisation, I have created different measures which helped in creating visuals easily and according to the demand by the hotel manager.  
This dashboard report consists of 4 pages -

1 - Home (When you click on icons you will be directed to that page

2 - Level 1 Metrics (Which includes insights about the Revenue)

3 - Level 2 Metrics (Which includes insights about the sales of hotel)

4 - Info Page (Basic information about the visual report is given here)

## Tech Stack
Visualisation: Power BI

Dependencies: MS Excel , DAX and M language for creating measures. 

Performance Metrics: MS Excel and Basic count , sum and VLOOKUP formulas.
